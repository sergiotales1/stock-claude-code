# PRD: Landing Page Render Stock Items

## Executive Summary

This feature will display product inventory items from the SQLite database on the landing page in an attractive, responsive grid layout. Users will be able to browse available products with images, names, descriptions, and quantities, with search functionality to filter results.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
Currently, there's no way for users to browse the available product inventory on the landing page. Products exist in the database but aren't visible to site visitors, reducing discoverability and engagement.

**Why is this important now?**
- Users need to see what products are available without navigating to admin/dashboard areas
- Product visibility drives engagement and potential conversions
- The existing Next.js infrastructure and Prisma schema are already in place

## User Stories

**Primary User Persona:** Site Visitor
- Age: 25-55
- Goal: Browse available products quickly and efficiently
- Pain points: Cannot see what's available, no way to search products

**User Journeys:**

1. **Browse Products**
   - User lands on homepage
   - User sees grid of product cards with images, names, and basic info
   - User can scroll through all available items

2. **Search Products**
   - User wants to find specific items
   - User types in search bar
   - Results filter in real-time by product name
   - User finds desired items quickly

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Core Features:**
- Display all products from Product model in responsive grid layout
- Show product image, name, description, and quantity for each item
- Implement search functionality to filter by product name
- Handle loading states during data fetching
- Handle error states if API calls fail

**User Interactions:**
- Search bar with real-time filtering
- Responsive grid that adapts to different screen sizes
- Image lazy loading for performance

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance:**
- Initial page load under 3 seconds
- Search filtering response under 500ms
- Images lazy-loaded to prevent blocking
- Grid should handle 100+ items without performance degradation

**Responsive Design:**
- Mobile: 1 column grid
- Tablet: 2-3 column grid
- Desktop: 4+ column grid
- Images maintain aspect ratio across devices

**Accessibility:**
- Alt text for all product images
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatible
- High contrast support

## Success Criteria

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- 100% of products in database are displayed
- Search functionality returns results within 500ms
- Page loads successfully on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Zero accessibility violations in automated testing

**Key Metrics:**
- Page load time < 3 seconds
- Search usage rate (% of visitors who use search)
- Product engagement (if click tracking added later)

## Constraints & Assumptions

**Technical Constraints:**
- Must use existing Prisma Product model schema
- Must integrate with existing Next.js 15.5.3 and React 19 setup
- Must use existing Tailwind CSS styling system
- SQLite database with current Product table structure

**Timeline Constraints:**
- Implementation should leverage existing codebase
- No database schema changes required

**Assumptions:**
- Product images will be valid URLs to external images
- Products have meaningful names and descriptions
- Quantity field represents available stock

## Out of Scope

**Explicitly NOT building:**
- Shopping cart functionality
- Product detail pages
- User authentication
- Product editing/management (admin features)
- Real-time inventory updates
- Payment processing
- Product categories or filtering beyond search

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**
- External image URLs must be accessible and valid
- Internet connectivity for loading external images

**Internal Dependencies:**
- Existing Prisma setup and database connection
- Next.js API routes for data fetching
- Tailwind CSS configuration

**Database Schema Dependencies:**
- Product model with fields: id, name, description, quantity, imageUrl, createdAt, updatedAt

## Technical Implementation Notes

**API Endpoint:**
- Create/use API route to fetch all products: `/api/products`
- Return JSON array of products with all required fields

**Component Structure:**
- ProductGrid component for layout
- ProductCard component for individual items
- SearchBar component for filtering
- Loading/Error components for states

**Data Flow:**
1. Page loads and calls products API
2. Display loading state while fetching
3. Render products in grid layout
4. Enable search filtering on client-side
5. Handle error states appropriately

**Styling Guidelines:**
- Use existing Tailwind configuration
- Maintain consistency with current design system
- Ensure responsive breakpoints align with app standards
