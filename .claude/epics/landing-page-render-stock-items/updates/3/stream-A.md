## Implementation Details

### Completed Features:
1. **GET /api/products endpoint** - Fully functional API route
2. **Prisma integration** - Uses shared client from `@/lib/prisma`
3. **Error handling** - Database connection errors return 500 status with logging
4. **TypeScript types** - Product and ProductsResponse interfaces defined
5. **Performance optimization** - Uses Prisma select for required fields only
6. **Caching** - Added Cache-Control headers for performance
7. **Data fields** - Returns id, name, description, quantity, imageUrl as required
