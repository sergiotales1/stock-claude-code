# Task: Build Core Product Display Components

## Description

Create reusable React components for displaying products: ProductGrid for layout management, ProductCard for individual product display, and SearchBar for filtering functionality. These components will form the foundation of the product display system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `ProductCard` component displaying product information
- [ ] Create `ProductGrid` component managing layout and product array
- [ ] Create `SearchBar` component with real-time search functionality
- [ ] Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all props
- [ ] Use existing Tailwind CSS classes and design tokens
- [ ] Ensure components are accessible with proper ARIA labels
- [ ] Handle missing/broken images gracefully
- [ ] Implement responsive design principles

## Implementation Notes

### Component Structure

#### ProductCard Component
```typescript
// src/components/ProductCard.tsx
interface ProductCardProps {
  product: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    description: string;
    quantity: number;
    imageUrl?: string;
  };
}
```

**Features:**
- Display product name, description, quantity
- Image with fallback for missing/broken images
- Proper aspect ratio maintenance
- Hover effects using Tailwind classes
- Accessible alt text and ARIA labels

#### ProductGrid Component
```typescript
// src/components/ProductGrid.tsx
interface ProductGridProps {
  products: Product[];
  searchTerm: string;
}
```

**Features:**
- Responsive grid layout (1 column mobile, 2-3 tablet, 4+ desktop)
- Filter products based on search term
- Handle empty states gracefully
- Use CSS Grid with Tailwind utilities

#### SearchBar Component
```typescript
// src/components/SearchBar.tsx
interface SearchBarProps {
  searchTerm: string;
  onSearchChange: (term: string) => void;
  placeholder?: string;
}
```

**Features:**
- Real-time search input with debouncing
- Clear search functionality
- Accessible form controls
- Search icon and styling consistent with app theme

### Styling Requirements

- Use existing Tailwind v4 CSS custom properties
- Maintain consistency with current design tokens
- Implement responsive breakpoints: mobile (1 col), tablet (2-3 cols), desktop (4+ cols)
- Hover states and interactive feedback
- Focus states for keyboard navigation

### Accessibility Requirements

- Proper semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management for search interactions
- Alt text for product images

## Dependencies

- TypeScript interfaces for Product data structure
- Existing Tailwind CSS configuration
- Next.js Image component for optimized images
- React hooks for state management

## Testing Requirements

- Component renders with mock product data
- Search functionality filters products correctly
- Responsive behavior across device sizes
- Image fallback handling for broken URLs
- Keyboard navigation works properly
- Screen reader compatibility

## Definition of Done

- All three components created and functional
- TypeScript interfaces properly defined
- Responsive design implemented
- Accessibility requirements met
- Components integrate seamlessly with existing design system
- Manual testing across different screen sizes completed
