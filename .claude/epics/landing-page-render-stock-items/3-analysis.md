# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #3

## Overview
Create a REST API endpoint `/api/products` that fetches all products from the database using Prisma client. This is a focused backend task with minimal file changes but multiple concerns that can be addressed in parallel.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: API Implementation
**Scope**: Create the core API endpoint with database queries
**Files**:
- `src/app/api/products/route.ts`
- `src/lib/prisma.ts` (if needs modification)
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 1.5
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: TypeScript Types & Error Handling
**Scope**: Define response types, error handling, and logging utilities
**Files**:
- `src/types/api.ts` (new)
- `src/lib/errors.ts` (new)
- `src/lib/logger.ts` (new)
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 1
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream C: Testing & Validation
**Scope**: Create tests for API endpoint and error scenarios
**Files**:
- `src/app/api/products/route.test.ts` (new)
- `__tests__/api/products.test.ts` (new)
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Stream A has basic implementation
**Estimated Hours**: 0.5
**Dependencies**: Stream A (needs endpoint to exist)

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
Minimal overlap:
- `package.json` - Both streams may add dev dependencies (testing libs)
- Type imports between Stream A and B

### Sequential Requirements
1. Stream A creates the basic endpoint structure
2. Stream B provides types that Stream A imports
3. Stream C tests the completed endpoint from Stream A

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Different directories and clear separation of concerns
- **Minimal Coordination**: Type imports easily managed
- **No File Conflicts**: Each stream has distinct file ownership

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: parallel

Launch Streams A & B simultaneously since they work on independent files. Stream C starts once Stream A has the basic endpoint structure in place (about 30 minutes into development).

Stream B can define API response types independently and Stream A can import them once available.

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 1.5 hours (limited by Stream A)
- Total work: 3 hours
- Efficiency gain: 50%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 3 hours

## Notes
This is a relatively simple task with good parallelization potential. The main bottleneck is that testing (Stream C) needs the endpoint to exist, but types and error handling can be developed completely independently of the core implementation.

Consider having Stream B also handle any Prisma client configuration if modifications are needed.
